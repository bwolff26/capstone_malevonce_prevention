something with art:
	the met... under museums



something with language

	brroooo  like riesh pesachim - preictors of future succuess per how they speakk
ie like criminals....

but could do with anything: president,s actors, etc.


fake news dataset, got hte link from kaggle


stam, look up the 'publicdomains'section.... os many juicy things there



brooooooo
	I just found a link to texas inmates last words...
		https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html
Perhaps I can do a difference between those and tweets/reddits... 

Based on social media posts....

also, look up 'complementary collections'



Perhaps something with suicide.

brooo
based upon likes, which century/country are you most like?

Number of tweets in the past 24 hours...

Hmm, it just dawned on me - isn't using the target features somehwat, ironically considering the name, getting to the target of detecting if it's hate speach
Ie I have an anti-semestic statement and I'm pondering if it's hateful. Is not the mere identification that it's talking about Jews already half-way therE?

Ie would it not be artificially basically telling the model 'hey.... this is about taget group x; well, albeit it's talking about Jews but perhaps it's benign
	Then their addition basically devolves into are they usually mentioned in a positive or negative context..
However, I do think supplying the mdoel with tones such as 'hey, this text is genocidal' and the like is better; def. hate speach? As it's getting into an emotion
conveyed by the words that the robot usually woudl not know. 

QQQQ imbalanced data... ie recall that our 2 group is only 6% of total...

So,c hecking stuff fom W6:

m1: Oversample the minority class:

pipe = make_pipeline(RandomOverSampler(random_state=34),
                    LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
gs = GidSearchCV(pipe,
                param_grid={'randomoversampler__sampling_strategy' : [.25, .5, .75, 1.0]},
                           n_jobs=-1)

gs2 = GidSearchCV(pipe,
                param_grid={'randomoversampler__sampling_strategy' : [.25, .5, .75, 1.0]},
                           n_jobs=-1, scoring='balanced_accuracy')



m2: artifical data
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
"ADASYN focuses on generating samples next to the original samples which are wrongly classified using a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier while the basic implementation of SMOTE will not make any distinction between easy and hard samples to be classified using the nearest neighbors rule." - the docs

m3: logr5 = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, class_weight=)
m4 chang class cutoff threshold

'imbalanced lear' library of scikit learn
eric - look at sepcficity fo that class..
[tw, three stadard deviations away...]
Q re.viewing metrics

at least your key metric 0; eh, you ca just obscur it...

Note that tfidf and cvec don't capture context; transformers would...

Re. using targets:

Off hand I think they get .85, so aim for that..

Sonyah:
sklearn.__version__

Terminal,
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/

Again, let's go over the following: We have huge clas imblanace... so, let us strive to balance it.
How do we do that? Well, 


Anyways, to do list:

TUNE for etiher sensitivity for 2 or specificity of 0...we can't jsut have the generic scorer...
