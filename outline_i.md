Incredibly Rough Rough Draft:

almost 70k tweeets, of whom 9k are explicitly suicidal and 6k are 'concerning'


1. What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?
2. Who is your audience?  Why will they care?
3. What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem in a useful way?
4. What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?
5. What are potential challenges or obstacles and how will you mitigate them?
6. Is this a reasonable project given the time constraints that you have?

# Proposals

P1 - THe school Board

3 focus on sensitivity
    ie care of the kids

P2 - Police Force

3 focus on precision
    ie car eof resources

P3 - Twitter

#change of words...

    might need more data

    Potential backlash re. contacting a not at risk...
    [obviously] false negatives... esp. re suicide

All of them can easily incorpoate webapp via plug in a tweet, with custom approaches dpeending upon the response:


Ie combine borderline with othe factors - low age, minority, 'classic bully target', etc., home stability
    Ie perhaps also find other datasets re. risk factors, analyze though and say, "Hey, if they have a suss tweet plus...

Sumit: if suicidal, maybe run it through a second model - scale ie resolv via school vs. police

Sonyah :degrees of scale.... and perhaps generalize by local sevices...
